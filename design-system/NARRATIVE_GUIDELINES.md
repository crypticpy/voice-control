## Narrative Philosophy

### The Core Belief

**We are guides, not gatekeepers.**

Technical education often fails because instructors position themselves as experts bestowing knowledge upon novices. This creates distance. Our approach is different: we're colleagues who learned this last month, sharing what worked with colleagues who are learning it this week.

The goal isn't to impress learners with complexity—it's to make them feel capable. Every sentence should leave them thinking "I can do this" rather than "this is complicated."

### Four Narrative Principles

**1. Respect Intelligence, Acknowledge Context**

Our learners are professionals. They manage complex systems, navigate bureaucracies, and solve problems daily. They're not struggling because they lack intelligence—they're struggling because they haven't had time or exposure. Write for smart people who are new to *this specific thing*, not smart people who need everything explained slowly.

**2. Earn Attention, Don't Assume It**

Government employees attend many trainings. Most are forgettable. Every paragraph must justify its existence. If something doesn't help the learner accomplish their goal, cut it. If an explanation runs long, find a shorter path. Respect their time by being efficient with their attention.

**3. Build Confidence Through Competence**

Confidence doesn't come from encouragement—it comes from successfully doing things. Our job is to structure experiences so learners succeed early and often. Each small win builds the foundation for tackling harder challenges. Sequence content so victories accumulate.

**4. Make It Fun to Fail**

Learning requires experimentation. Experimentation requires permission to mess up. We use humor and lightness to signal that mistakes are expected, even welcomed. A learner who's afraid to break something won't discover anything. We want them clicking buttons, trying weird prompts, and seeing what happens—because that's how real learning works.

---

## Voice and Tone

### The Voice

Our voice is **knowledgeable, direct, collegial, and playful**.

- **Knowledgeable**: We know this material deeply. We don't hedge unnecessarily or use vague language when precision is possible. We anticipate questions because we've asked them ourselves.

- **Direct**: We get to the point. We use active voice, concrete language, and short sentences when clarity demands it. We don't pad content with qualifiers or meander through concepts.

- **Collegial**: We're peers sharing expertise, not authorities lecturing subordinates. We use "we" and "you" naturally. We acknowledge challenges without dramatizing them. We celebrate progress without condescension.

- **Playful**: We don't take ourselves too seriously. A well-placed joke, a self-deprecating aside, an acknowledgment of absurdity—these make content human. Learning should be enjoyable, not endured. We're serious about the material, not somber about it.

### Tone Calibration

Tone shifts based on content type and moment. The voice stays constant; the tone adapts.

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Introducing concepts** | Curious, inviting | "Here's something interesting about how voice recognition actually works..." |
| **Step-by-step instructions** | Clear, confident | "Open Settings. Click Modes. Select Create Custom Mode." |
| **Explaining why** | Thoughtful, connecting | "This matters because your audio contains the same sensitive information as your typed notes—it needs the same protection." |
| **Addressing errors** | Calm, solution-focused | "If you see this error, it usually means the model hasn't finished loading. Wait 10 seconds and try again." |
| **Celebrating completion** | Warm, genuine | "That's it—you've built a working custom mode. The rest is refinement." |
| **Warning about risks** | Serious, not alarming | "Cloud models send your audio to external servers. For any content involving PHI, use local models instead." |
| **Encouraging experimentation** | Light, permission-giving | "Go ahead—try the weirdest prompt you can think of. The AI won't judge you, and you might discover something useful." |
| **Acknowledging difficulty** | Empathetic, humorous | "If this feels confusing, you're in good company. It took me three tries to get this right the first time." |

### Words That Define Us

**We say:** clear, straightforward, practical, efficient, secure, capable, useful, fun, experiment, try, play
**We avoid:** simple (implies condescension), just (minimizes effort), obviously (assumes knowledge), basically (filler), etc. (be specific), fail (use "doesn't work yet" or "needs adjustment")

### Using Humor Effectively

Humor is a tool, not decoration. Used well, it:
- Lowers anxiety ("If I can joke about it, it must not be that scary")
- Creates connection ("This person is human, like me")
- Makes content memorable (we remember what makes us smile)
- Signals safety ("It's okay to not be perfect here")

**Types of humor that work:**

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Self-deprecation** | "I spent an embarrassing amount of time on this before realizing the model wasn't downloaded." | Normalizes struggle, builds trust |
| **Absurdist observations** | "You're essentially teaching a very eager but very literal robot to write your emails." | Makes abstract concepts tangible and memorable |
| **Gentle sarcasm** | "The error message 'Something went wrong' is, as always, incredibly helpful." | Shared frustration builds camaraderie |
| **Playful challenges** | "Try to confuse it. Seriously. See what happens when you dictate song lyrics." | Encourages experimentation |
| **Unexpected honesty** | "Will this work perfectly? No. Will it work better than what you're doing now? Almost certainly." | Disarming, realistic |

**Types of humor to avoid:**

| Type | Why to Avoid |
|------|--------------|
| **Jokes at learner's expense** | Creates anxiety, damages trust |
| **Inside jokes** | Excludes people, feels cliquish |
| **Forced puns** | Falls flat, feels try-hard |
| **Excessive silliness** | Undermines credibility |
| **Sarcasm about the material** | Suggests we don't value what we're teaching |

**The 10% rule:** Humor should be about 10% of your content—enough to create lightness, not so much that it overwhelms substance. If every paragraph has a joke, none of them land.

## The Learner Relationship

### Who They Are

Our learners are:

- **Busy professionals** — They have jobs to do; this training is an interruption they hope will pay off
- **Pragmatic** — They want tools that work, not theoretical understanding for its own sake
- **Risk-aware** — In government health work, mistakes have consequences; they're appropriately cautious
- **Experienced** — They've learned complex systems before; they know how to learn
- **Skeptical** — They've seen technology promises before; they'll believe it when they see it work

### What They Need From Us

| Need | How We Meet It |
|------|----------------|
| **Proof it's worth their time** | Lead with practical outcomes, not feature lists |
| **Confidence they can succeed** | Small early wins, clear progress markers |
| **Safety from embarrassment** | Normalize mistakes, provide troubleshooting |
| **Efficiency** | Dense content, no fluff, respect for time |
| **Permission to experiment** | Frame exercises as exploration, not tests |
| **Enjoyment** | Humor, lightness, interesting examples, moments of delight |

### Creating Permission to Experiment

Adult learners often resist experimentation because they fear:
- Looking foolish in front of peers
- Breaking something
- Wasting time on "wrong" approaches
- Being judged for curiosity

**Our job is to actively counter these fears:**

**Normalize the mess:**
> "Your first prompt will probably be terrible. Mine was. Here's what I started with: [embarrassing example]. Here's what it became after five revisions: [good example]. That journey is normal."

**Remove stakes:**
> "Nothing you do here can break anything permanently. The worst case is you get weird output, laugh at it, and try again."

**Celebrate curiosity:**
> "What happens if you ask it to write in iambic pentameter? I don't know—try it and tell me."

**Frame exercises as play:**
> "This isn't a test. There's no grade. The goal is to discover what works for *your* brain and *your* workflow."

**Share your own experiments:**
> "I once tried to get it to write error messages in the style of a Shakespearean tragedy. It was ridiculous and completely useless. But I learned something about how the model handles tone."

### The "Try Something Weird" Moments

Every major exercise should include at least one explicit invitation to experiment:

- "Before moving on, spend 2 minutes trying something unexpected. What happens if you..."
- "Bonus challenge: See if you can make it produce [intentionally silly output]."
- "Your turn: Change one thing in this prompt that we didn't cover. What happens?"

These moments signal that:
1. Exploration is valued, not just compliance
2. There's more to discover than what's in the tutorial
3. Their creativity matters

### The Relationship Arc

**Beginning of training:** We're a credible guide who understands their world
**Middle of training:** We're a supportive partner as they try new things
**End of training:** We're a reference they return to when needed

## Structuring Explanations

### The Explanation Formula

For any concept, follow this structure:

```
1. HOOK      — Why should they care? (1-2 sentences)
2. WHAT      — What is this thing? (1-2 sentences, concrete)
3. WHY       — Why does it work this way? (only if useful)
4. HOW       — How do they use it? (specific, actionable)
5. VERIFY    — How do they know it worked? (observable outcome)
```

**Example: Explaining Local Processing**

> **HOOK:** Your voice contains the same sensitive information as your typed notes—and it needs the same protection.
>
> **WHAT:** Local processing means your audio is converted to text entirely on your device. It never travels to external servers.
>
> **WHY:** This matters for PHI compliance. If audio never leaves your machine, there's no transmission to secure, no third-party access to audit.
>
> **HOW:** In SuperWhisper, select any model labeled "LOCAL" or without a cloud icon. The free models—Fast, Standard, Nano—are all local.
>
> **VERIFY:** You can test this by turning off your WiFi. Local models still work. Cloud models will fail.

### The Inverted Pyramid

Lead with the most important information. Details follow for those who need them.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   THE CORE POINT                    │  ← Everyone reads this
│   (one sentence)                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   The essential context             │  ← Most people read this
│   (2-3 sentences)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Supporting details, examples,     │  ← Some people read this
│   edge cases, exceptions            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Deep background, history,         │  ← Few people read this
│   advanced considerations           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Apply this ruthlessly.** If someone stops reading after the first sentence, they should still have the key takeaway.

### Chunking Complex Topics

When a topic has multiple parts, make the structure visible:

**Bad:** One long paragraph covering three related concepts.

**Good:**
> Voice-to-text tools handle three distinct tasks:
>
> **Transcription** converts your speech to raw text. This is what happens when you dictate and see your words appear.
>
> **Processing** transforms that raw text according to your instructions. This is where "um" gets removed and formatting gets applied.
>
> **Output** delivers the result to your target application. This is the final text that appears in your email or document.
>
> Understanding these as separate steps helps when troubleshooting. If transcription is accurate but output is wrong, the issue is in processing—not in how you spoke.

### Transitions That Teach

Transitions aren't just bridges—they're opportunities to reinforce learning.

**Weak transition:** "Next, let's look at custom modes."

**Strong transition:** "Now that you can dictate and see text appear, let's make that text actually useful. Custom modes transform raw dictation into polished output—professional emails, structured prompts, formatted chat messages."

The strong version:
1. Acknowledges what they just learned
2. Creates anticipation for what's next
3. Explains the *relationship* between concepts

## Writing Patterns by Content Type

### Pattern A: Conceptual Explanation

**Purpose:** Help learners understand *what* something is and *why* it matters.

**Structure:**
```
[Relatable hook that connects to their experience]

[Clear definition in plain language]

[The key insight or mental model]

[Concrete example from their context]

[Connection to what they'll do with this knowledge]
```

**Example: Explaining "Modes"**

> You probably use your voice differently when leaving a voicemail than when talking to a colleague. Same voice, different context, different output.
>
> SuperWhisper modes work the same way. A mode is a saved configuration that defines how your speech gets processed: which AI model to use, what instructions to follow, how to format the output.
>
> The key insight: **one hotkey, infinite outputs**. You speak naturally; the mode handles the translation to whatever format you need.
>
> Think about your workday. You might write formal emails to external partners, quick updates to your team on Teams, and detailed prompts for AI tools. Each needs different formatting—but you could dictate all three with the same natural speech. The mode adapts, not you.
>
> In the next section, you'll create your first custom mode. It will transform your dictation into professional emails automatically.

### Pattern B: Step-by-Step Instructions

**Purpose:** Guide learners through a specific procedure with minimal friction.

**Structure:**
```
[Brief context: what they'll accomplish]

STEP 1: [Action verb] [specific target]
[Single sentence explanation if needed]
[Expected result]

STEP 2: [Action verb] [specific target]
...

[Verification that the whole sequence worked]
```

**Key Rules:**
- One action per step (sub-actions are okay, but group logically)
- Start each step with a verb
- Include expected results so they can verify
- Number every step (don't skip numbers)
- Keep explanations minimal—save depth for conceptual sections

**Example:**

> You'll create a custom mode that transforms dictation into professional emails.
>
> **Step 1: Open SuperWhisper Settings**
> Click the SuperWhisper icon in your menu bar, then click the gear icon.
> *You should see the Settings window with tabs on the left.*
>
> **Step 2: Navigate to Modes**
> Click "Modes" in the left sidebar.
> *You should see your existing modes listed, plus a button to create new ones.*
>
> **Step 3: Create a new mode**
> Click "+ Create Custom Mode" at the bottom of the list.
> *A new mode configuration panel opens.*
>
> **Step 4: Name your mode**
> Enter "Professional Email" in the name field.
> *The name appears in your mode switcher, so make it recognizable.*

### Pattern C: Code and Prompt Walkthrough

**Purpose:** Explain technical content (prompts, configurations, code) line by line.

**Structure:**
```
[What this code/prompt accomplishes]

[The full code block, properly formatted]

[Line-by-line or section-by-section breakdown]

[Common modifications they might make]
```

**Key Rules:**
- Show the complete code first, then explain
- Group related lines in your explanation
- Highlight the parts they're most likely to customize
- Explain *why* things are structured this way, not just *what* they do

**Example:**

> This prompt transforms dictated speech into professional emails. Here's the complete configuration:
>
> ```xml
> <role>
>   You are a professional email editor for a government health department.
> </role>
>
> <instructions>
>   The User Message is dictated speech. Format it into a professional email:
>   - Add appropriate greeting based on context
>   - Structure into clear paragraphs
>   - Include professional closing
>   - If Selected Text exists, treat it as the email being replied to
> </instructions>
>
> <requirements>
>   - Professional but warm tone
>   - Clear, concise language
>   - Appropriate for government workplace
> </requirements>
> ```
>
> Let's break this down:
>
> **The `<role>` section** tells the AI who it's pretending to be. "Government health department" is specific—it establishes context that influences word choice and formality level. You might change this to match your specific agency.
>
> **The `<instructions>` section** defines the task. Note the bullet points—these give the AI a checklist. The mention of "Selected Text" enables reply functionality: if you highlight an email before dictating, the AI knows you're responding to it.
>
> **The `<requirements>` section** sets constraints. These act as guardrails. "Professional but warm" is more useful than just "professional"—it prevents the AI from being overly stiff.
>
> **Customization ideas:** If you write to external partners often, add "formal tone for external recipients" to requirements. If you have a standard signature, add it to instructions.

### Pattern D: Troubleshooting Guide

**Purpose:** Help learners diagnose and fix problems independently.

**Structure:**
```
[Symptom they're experiencing - in their words]

[Most likely cause - brief explanation]

[Fix - specific steps]

[Verification - how they know it worked]
```

**Key Rules:**
- Lead with the symptom, not the cause
- Order by likelihood (most common first)
- Be specific about the fix
- Don't explain the underlying system unless necessary for the fix

**Example:**

> **Problem: Mode doesn't auto-activate when I open Outlook**
>
> The auto-activation rule probably doesn't match the app name exactly.
>
> **Fix:**
> 1. Open SuperWhisper Settings → Modes
> 2. Select your email mode
> 3. Scroll to Auto-Activation Rules
> 4. Check that "Microsoft Outlook" is listed (not just "Outlook")
> 5. Try adding "Outlook" as a second rule if the first doesn't match
>
> **Verify:** Close and reopen Outlook. The mode indicator in your menu bar should change.
>
> **Still not working?** Some Outlook versions register differently. Try setting the mode manually once, then check Settings to see how SuperWhisper identified the app.

### Pattern E: Comparison/Decision Content

**Purpose:** Help learners choose between options.

**Structure:**
```
[Frame the decision they're making]

[Option A: when to use, key characteristics, tradeoffs]

[Option B: when to use, key characteristics, tradeoffs]

[Clear recommendation or decision framework]
```

**Key Rules:**
- Be opinionated—make a recommendation
- Use parallel structure for each option
- Focus on *when* to use each, not just *what* they are
- Include the tradeoffs honestly

**Example:**

> When choosing between local and cloud processing, the decision comes down to one question: **does your content include sensitive information?**
>
> **Local Processing**
> Use for: PHI, patient data, internal communications, anything you wouldn't email unencrypted
> How it works: Audio never leaves your device; all processing happens locally
> Tradeoff: Slightly lower accuracy (88-92% vs 97%), slower on older hardware
> Models: Fast, Standard, Nano (all free), Ultra Turbo v3 (Pro)
>
> **Cloud Processing**
> Use for: Personal notes, creative projects, content you'd post publicly anyway
> How it works: Audio is sent to external servers, processed, and returned
> Tradeoff: Higher accuracy and speed, but audio travels over the internet
> Models: Ultra, Nova (Pro only)
>
> **Our recommendation:** Default to local. It's free, it's private, and it's accurate enough for professional use. Only switch to cloud for non-sensitive content where you need maximum accuracy—like transcribing a podcast episode.

## Terminology Standards

### Core Vocabulary

Consistency builds familiarity. Use these terms exactly as defined.

| Term | Definition | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Local processing** | Audio converted to text entirely on the user's device | Never "offline processing" or "on-device" |
| **Cloud processing** | Audio sent to external servers for conversion | Never "online processing" |
| **Mode** | A saved configuration in SuperWhisper | Not "profile," "template," or "preset" |
| **PHI** | Protected Health Information | Always define on first use in any document |
| **Dictation** | The act of speaking to create text | Use for the action |
| **Transcription** | The text output from dictation | Use for the result |
| **Prompt** | Instructions given to an AI | Not "query" or "request" |
| **Auto-activation** | Automatic mode switching based on context | Hyphenated |
| **Context** | Information passed to the AI (app, selection, clipboard) | Be specific: "application context," "selected text context" |

### Phrases to Standardize

| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| "Select the Fast model" | "Choose the Fast model" |
| "Click Settings" | "Go to Settings" / "Navigate to Settings" |
| "Enter your prompt" | "Type your prompt" / "Input your prompt" |
| "The AI processes your speech" | "The AI handles your speech" |
| "Your content stays on your device" | "Your content never leaves your device" (too dramatic) |
| "For PHI-safe processing" | "For HIPAA compliance" (we're not lawyers) |

### Technical Terms: Define on First Use

When introducing technical terms, define them inline:

> SuperWhisper uses **modes**—saved configurations that define how your speech gets processed.

After first use, use the term freely without redefinition within the same document. In a new document, redefine.

### Naming Conventions for User-Created Content

When instructing users to name things, suggest specific names:

**Good:** "Name your mode 'Professional Email' or 'Work Email'"
**Bad:** "Name your mode something descriptive"

Specific suggestions reduce cognitive load and improve consistency when troubleshooting.

---

## Thematic Framework

### The Central Metaphor

**Voice as a new input channel—not a replacement, but an expansion.**

Keyboards aren't going away. Voice adds a new option for contexts where typing is slow, awkward, or impossible. This framing:
- Avoids threatening existing skills
- Positions voice as additive, not disruptive
- Emphasizes practical application over novelty

### The Narrative Arc Across the Course

**Part 1: Foundation**
*Theme: "You already know how to talk. Now let's make that useful."*

We establish that voice-driven development builds on skills they have. The tools are new; the capability (speaking) isn't. We focus on setup, understanding, and first successes.

**Part 2: Application**
*Theme: "Your voice, your workflows."*

We move from controlled exercises to real work. Learners apply tools to their own projects. We support customization and troubleshooting. The training becomes personal.

**Part 3: Integration**
*Theme: "Building with voice as a native tool."*

We tackle a substantial project together—the meeting transcriber. Voice-driven development becomes just another tool in their toolkit, not a special skill requiring special context.

### Recurring Motifs

Weave these ideas throughout all content:

**Efficiency through adaptation**
The tools adapt to you, not the reverse. Modes switch automatically. Context gets captured. You speak naturally; the system does the translation.

**Privacy as a feature, not a constraint**
Local processing isn't a limitation—it's a capability. You get to use powerful AI tools *because* they run locally, not *despite* it.

**Professional capability**
This isn't consumer tech repurposed—it's professional tooling. The use cases are work-focused. The examples come from government/health contexts. The output is polished.

**Iteration over perfection**
First attempts won't be perfect. Custom modes improve over time. Prompts get refined. This is expected, not a failure.

**Play as learning**
The best way to understand a tool is to mess around with it. Exercises aren't tests—they're playgrounds. Curiosity is rewarded. Weird experiments teach more than careful compliance.

### Language That Reinforces Themes

| Theme | Language Patterns |
|-------|-------------------|
| Adaptation | "The mode adapts...", "automatically detects...", "matches your context..." |
| Privacy | "stays on your device", "no external transmission", "PHI-safe" |
| Professionalism | "polished output", "professional email", "workplace-appropriate" |
| Iteration | "refine over time", "adjust based on results", "your first version" |
| Experimentation | "try it", "see what happens", "play with", "experiment with", "what if you..." |
| Permission | "there's no wrong answer", "you can always undo", "nothing breaks permanently" |

## Context-Specific Adaptations

The voice stays constant. Delivery adapts to medium.

### Written Tutorials (Worksheets, Guides)

**Characteristics:**
- Self-paced, reference-able
- Reader controls the pace
- Can scan and skip
- Print-friendly

**Adaptations:**
- Use more structure (headers, bullets, numbered steps)
- Front-load key information (they might not read to the end)
- Include checkpoints ("At this point, you should see...")
- Provide troubleshooting inline
- Write for scanning, not linear reading

**Example opening:**
> This exercise guides you through creating a custom mode for professional emails. You'll configure auto-activation, write AI instructions, and test with sample dictation.
>
> **Time:** 15 minutes
> **Outcome:** A working email mode you can use immediately

### Live Presentation (Slides, Demos)

**Characteristics:**
- Presenter-paced
- Audience can't rewind
- Attention competes with environment
- Questions can interrupt flow

**Adaptations:**
- Shorter sentences, simpler structure
- Repeat key points (they might miss the first time)
- Signpost constantly ("First... Next... Finally...")
- Build in pauses after important information
- Use questions to check understanding

**Example narration:**
> "So now we've set up our first mode. Let me show you what it actually does.
>
> I'm going to open Outlook—watch the menu bar. See how it switched? That's auto-activation. The mode detected I'm in an email app and switched automatically.
>
> Now I'll dictate something messy—the way you'd actually talk—and we'll see what comes out."

### Video Content (Recorded Tutorials)

**Characteristics:**
- Viewer can pause, rewind
- No live interaction
- Competes with other media
- Visuals do heavy lifting

**Adaptations:**
- Tighter pacing than live (no waiting for room)
- Narration complements visuals, doesn't duplicate
- Use verbal markers for navigation ("In this section...")
- Preview outcomes at the start
- Summarize at the end

**Example script:**
> [VISUAL: SuperWhisper menu bar icon]
> "SuperWhisper lives in your menu bar. You'll see this icon—it shows your current mode and processing status."
>
> [VISUAL: Click to expand menu]
> "Clicking it reveals your modes. Notice I have five here—we'll build these together."
>
> [VISUAL: Highlight 'Email' mode]
> "Let's start with this one: the Email mode. By the end of this video, you'll have one just like it."

### Informal Help (Troubleshooting, Q&A)

**Characteristics:**
- User is stuck or frustrated
- Needs quick, specific help
- Wants solution, not explanation
- Context may be unclear

**Adaptations:**
- Lead with the solution
- Ask clarifying questions efficiently
- Don't lecture—fix the problem
- Offer to explain *after* solving
- Acknowledge frustration without dwelling

**Example response:**
> "That error usually means the local model isn't installed yet. Open SuperWhisper Settings, go to Models, and click Download next to 'Fast.' Once it finishes, try again.
>
> Does that fix it? If not, let me know what you see after the download completes."

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: The Expertise Curse

**What it looks like:** Using jargon without noticing, skipping "obvious" steps, assuming context.

**Example:**
*"Configure the LLM parameters and set the context window appropriately."*

**Fix:** Read your content as if you've never seen the tool. Every technical term needs introduction. Every step needs to be explicit.

**Better:**
*"The Language Model settings control how the AI processes your speech. Leave these at defaults for now—we'll customize in Part 2."*

### Pitfall 2: Over-Qualification

**What it looks like:** Hedging every statement, adding disclaimers, avoiding commitment.

**Example:**
*"This might work for some users, depending on their setup, though results may vary and some configurations could potentially cause issues."*

**Fix:** Be direct. If something has conditions, state them clearly. If there are exceptions, list them. But default to confidence.

**Better:**
*"This works for most setups. If you're on an older Mac (pre-2020), see the troubleshooting section—you may need a lighter model."*

### Pitfall 3: False Friendliness

**What it looks like:** Excessive exclamation points, forced enthusiasm, condescending encouragement.

**Example:**
*"Great job! You did it! Wasn't that easy? You're going to love this next part!"*

**Fix:** Warmth comes from respect, not cheerleading. Acknowledge accomplishments without theatrics.

**Better:**
*"That's the core setup done. The next section builds on this foundation—you'll customize the output to match your actual workflow."*

### Pitfall 4: Explaining Everything

**What it looks like:** Comprehensive background before any action, history lessons, theoretical tangents.

**Example:**
*"To understand modes, we first need to understand how speech recognition evolved from the 1950s through the development of neural networks and transformer architectures..."*

**Fix:** Explain what they need to succeed at the current task. Save depth for those who want it (separate sections, optional readings).

**Better:**
*"A mode is a saved configuration. Think of it as a preset: you define once how you want your speech processed, and you can switch between different setups instantly."*

### Pitfall 5: Burying the Action

**What it looks like:** Long lead-ups before telling them what to do, explanations before instructions.

**Example:**
*"The next thing we need to consider is the importance of selecting an appropriate model, which as you may recall from the previous section involves understanding the tradeoffs between local and cloud processing, and so with that in mind, you should now click on Settings."*

**Fix:** Action first, explanation after (or integrated).

**Better:**
*"Click Settings. You'll see two model options: local and cloud. For now, select a local model—we'll explain why in a moment."*

## Examples and Anti-Examples

### Example Set 1: Opening a Tutorial

**Anti-example (too academic):**
> This tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview of the mode creation process within the SuperWhisper application, enabling you to construct customized configurations that facilitate optimized speech-to-text transformation tailored to your specific use cases.

**Anti-example (too casual):**
> Hey there! Ready to make your first mode? It's super easy, don't worry! Just follow along and you'll be a pro in no time! 😊

**Good example:**
> You'll create a custom mode that transforms your dictation into professional emails. By the end, you'll have a working configuration that auto-activates when you open Outlook and produces polished output from natural speech.
>
> This takes about 15 minutes. Let's start.

### Example Set 2: Explaining a Concept

**Anti-example (too technical):**
> Local processing leverages on-device ML inference to perform ASR without network egress, ensuring data sovereignty and eliminating third-party processing concerns.

**Anti-example (too vague):**
> Local processing is when the AI runs on your computer instead of somewhere else, which is better for privacy and stuff.

**Good example:**
> Local processing means your speech is converted to text entirely on your device. The audio never travels to external servers.
>
> Why this matters: if audio never leaves your machine, there's no transmission to secure, no third-party access to audit. Your content stays under your control.

### Example Set 3: Step Instructions

**Anti-example (too verbose):**
> The first thing you're going to want to do is locate the SuperWhisper application icon, which should be visible in your menu bar if you're using a Mac or in your system tray if you're using Windows. Once you've found it, you'll want to click on it with your mouse to reveal a dropdown menu that contains various options.

**Anti-example (too terse):**
> Click SuperWhisper. Click Settings.

**Good example:**
> **Step 1: Open SuperWhisper Settings**
> Click the SuperWhisper icon in your menu bar, then click the gear icon.
>
> *You should see the Settings window with tabs on the left sidebar.*

### Example Set 4: Error Handling

**Anti-example (alarming):**
> WARNING! If this error appears, something may be seriously wrong with your configuration! You may have corrupted your settings!

**Anti-example (dismissive):**
> Just ignore that error, it doesn't matter.

**Good example:**
> If you see "Model not found," the local model hasn't finished downloading. Open SuperWhisper Settings → Models and check the download progress. Once complete, the error will resolve.
>
> This is common on first use—the models are large and take a few minutes to download.

### Example Set 5: Transitions

**Anti-example (abrupt):**
> That was modes. Now let's do prompts.

**Anti-example (overwrought):**
> And so, having journeyed through the fascinating world of mode creation, we now stand at the threshold of an even more exciting frontier: the art and science of prompt engineering!

**Good example:**
> Your mode is configured—now let's make it smarter. The prompt is where you tell the AI exactly how to transform your speech. A good prompt turns rambling dictation into polished output.

### Example Set 6: Using Humor

**Anti-example (trying too hard):**
> LOL, who knew talking to your computer could be so wacky?! 🤪 Get ready for some WILD times with voice recognition!!!

**Anti-example (no personality):**
> The model may occasionally produce incorrect output. This is expected behavior.

**Good example:**
> The AI will occasionally misinterpret you in creative ways. Last week, "schedule a meeting with Sarah" became "schedule a meeting with the Sahara." The model was technically correct—it is a proper noun—but probably not what you wanted. This is why we test.

**Good example (normalizing struggle):**
> My first prompt was terrible. I wrote something like "make my words better" and was genuinely surprised when the output was vague and unhelpful. Turns out AI responds well to specificity. Who knew? (Everyone. Everyone knew. I just hadn't read the documentation yet.)

**Good example (encouraging experimentation):**
> What happens if you dictate in a funny accent? I have no idea. Try it. The AI might handle it fine, or it might produce something unintentionally hilarious. Either way, you'll learn something about how it processes speech patterns.

### Example Set 7: Encouraging Experimentation

**Anti-example (no permission):**
> Follow these steps exactly as written.

**Anti-example (too open-ended):**
> Do whatever you want, I guess?

**Good example:**
> Follow these steps to create your first working mode. Once it's working, spend five minutes breaking it on purpose. Change the prompt to something absurd. See what happens. You can always reset to the original—and you'll understand the system better by pushing its limits.

**Good example (explicit invitation):**
> **Bonus challenge:** Can you make the AI respond entirely in questions? Try modifying the prompt to find out. There's no practical reason to do this—it's just interesting to see if you can.

**Good example (framing failure positively):**
> If your output looks weird, congratulations—you've discovered a boundary. That's actually useful information. Note what you tried, and we'll troubleshoot together.

### Example Set 8: Acknowledging Difficulty

**Anti-example (dismissive):**
> This is easy, just follow along.

**Anti-example (dramatic):**
> This next part is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT and many people struggle with it!

**Good example:**
> This next section trips people up. The concepts are straightforward, but the interface is a bit buried. I'll point out exactly where to click—if you get lost, check the screenshot.

**Good example (with humor):**
> Writing prompts is one of those skills that seems like it should be obvious and then absolutely isn't. If your first few attempts produce garbage, you're in excellent company. Keep iterating.
